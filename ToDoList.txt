NEXT STEPS

-Use Recieve From Syscall to get data from server.
    - Copy the used recieve from syscall that the server uses
    - It points to the data's buffer
        
     .read:
        mov rax, 0x00                       ; read syscall
        mov rdi, qword [read_buffer_fd]     ; read buffer fd
        mov rsi, msg_buf                    ; buffer pointer where message will be saved
        mov rdx, 1024                       ; message buffer size
        syscall
        
        mov qword [chars_received], rax     ; save number of received chars to global  
        
-Save Data to Heap using a pointer
    - Change the data's buffer pointer to the heap using pointer

      *Alternatively I think we could move it into a predetermined memory address of a large enough size
      *When we write to the file I think the stack will cause issues.
      
-Save the data into a file and do the sorting
    -Move the data from the heap to a file

-Create an algo to sort the info in the file?

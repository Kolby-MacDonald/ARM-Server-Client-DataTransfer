Purpose: To analyze the provided test_server_lh_8080.nasm program

section .data
    - contains connection success and failure messages
    - contains usage message as well
    - sockaddr_in?

section .bss
    - reserves space for checksums used late

_start:
    -SIGPIPE Set to ignore
    -Call _network.init:
        - Bind to socket using IF_INET
        - If failed Bind using sockaddr
        - Send failure or success message
    -Call _network.listen:
        - Listen for connection
        - Print success message
* Confused how the program continues from here but i think it goes into the following.
    -.retry?
        -connection = true 
        -print hello message
        -write text to socket
            -? maybe to capture an enter or something?
    -.net_read_loop
        -tell the user to enter their message
    -.net_read_loop_nomsg
        -confirm characters recieved
        -check for command
            -compare string to string in a register
            -if valid: returns command number
                -cmd_1_exit_l, cmd_2_do_something_else
        -1: command is cmd_1_exit_l
            - exit (done by comparing command number and jumping to exit)
        -2: command is cmd_2_do_something_else continue
            -remove '\n' from chars
            -convert ascii chars in buffer to hex
        -if everything is valid
            -end
